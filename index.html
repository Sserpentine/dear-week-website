        <h2>The American Writers Museum</h2> <br>
        <p>I have inferred that the American Writers Museum was physical until a while back. Since the world has changed a lot they decided to make the museum virtual as well as physical. The virtual museum will have all the interactive videos and games as the physical museum had. They also have story time in which famous authors read books for children.</p> <br><br>
        <h2>Books Alive</h2> <br>
        <p>Books alive is a children’s library that is virtual as well as physical. The website has videos of workers reading books out loud to an audience.

        <h2>My book: Nancy drew and hardy boys: Bonfire Masquerade</h2> <br>
        <p>I would recommend this book to you if you are a big fan of mystery and Nancy Drew or Hardy boys. In very few books do Nancy and Frank and Joe Hardy actually meet. In this book they meet halfway through when they bump into each other while solving two completely different mysteries. I am a big fan of Carolyn Keene and Franklin W. Dixon. I really enjoyed this book as there is a lot of suspense and a lot of sub-mysteries that they solve to find out the actual solution. Sometimes, the conclusion is very shocking like this book’s. Carolyn Keene and Franklin W. Dixon has written many successful books that are read all over the world. I highly recommend you read this book and join the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys fans.</p> <br><br>

        <h2>Carolyn Keene:</h2> <br>
        <p>1. What inspired you to write Nancy Drew? <br>
            2. Who would you think of when I say Bess and George? <br>
            3. Did you have a real life Ned Nickerson? <br> <br>
            </p>
        <h2>Franklin W Dixon</h2>
        <p>
            1. What inspired you to write Hardy Boys? <br>
            2. Who comes to mind when I say Chet Morton?<br>
            3. Did you have a real life Callie Shaw or Iola Morton? <br>

        <p>In my opinion, I think that the DEAR week is a amazing idea. I have had so much fun reading and creating creative portfolios. I really enjoyed all the meet the authors sessions. The one I enjoyed the most was the one by Miss Piya Bahadur. Her journey was really inspiring. I think that you should have more events like this in the future. You should also ask the students what they would prefer having as an event next time. I would suggest for the DEAR week if you give us more books to read from and more genres to pick from.</p>
